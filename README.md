## Welcome to **Balancer Simulations**! 

Balancer Simulations is a project of TE-AMM and the Token Engineering Community, funded by grants from [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/) and [PowerPool](https://powerpool.finance/), and kicked off by [EthicHub](https://www.ethichub.com/en/).  
It aims to build infrastructure and knowledge for rigorous Balancer Token Engineering to leverage the full power of Balancer Pools as a core building block in DeFi.
We invite any project building on Balancer Pools to join our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/KTUPMCRZNQ), use the model, and benefit from Balancer Simulations.

- Analyze existing Balancer Pools using on-chain transaction data,  understand pool characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses
- Gain intuition by exploring pool variants, observe system behavior over time, derive the most valuable monitoring metrics for your use case
- Run experiments based on historical transactions, mix historical and synthetic transactions to model particular market scenarios
- Develop and test adaptive Dynamic AMM solutions, like Dynamic Weights Changing, test and optimize controls and feedback loops
- Model agent behavior and apply Reinforcement Learning to run stress tests for a proposed system design

All research and models are available through open source repositories, and will be further developed by TE-AMM.
