# Balancer AMM cadCAD model
This repo contains the Python code, input data samples and several Python notebooks allowing users to simulate Balancer pools.

It is ongoing work and repo updates all the time.

Roadmap:

**Phase 1:** 
Phase 01 goal is to provide Balancer AMM functionality in a cadCAD model and run a set of simulations with historical data to demonstrate model operation and produce educational materials helping to gain in-depth understanding and intuition of Balancer AMM and AMMs in general.

**Phase 2:** 
More complex cases, including: agents behavior, dynamic weights changing in the AMM equation, particular cases for EthicHub and PowerPool
